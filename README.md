# Julia - Bit by Bit (ISBN 978-3-030-73935-5)

I've not really made time to explore the language, so when a colleague raved
about how awesome Julia was, I decided to borrow a book and work through the
basics, as usual.

This book is for people who may not have programming experience, so it might
be a good idea to skim the intro if you already have spent some time coding.

## Prerequisites

What I was working with, not what the book requests:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Julia 1.8.5 (via snap)

I'm surprised nobody has packaged Julia for the official apt repo yet. Maybe
snap is the way of the future, or it's just not popular enough.
